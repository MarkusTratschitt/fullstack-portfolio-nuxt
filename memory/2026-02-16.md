## Repo / CI / PR Learnings
- Worked on `fullstack-portfolio-nuxt` to satisfy protected-branch required checks.
- Added missing required workflows and baseline scripts/tests for:
  - `lint`
  - `typecheck`
  - `unit-tests`
  - `e2e-smoke`
- Diagnosed and fixed CI failures iteratively (especially `typecheck` import/type issues in Nuxt/Vue files).
- Confirmed rule in practice: no direct push to protected `master`; changes must go through PR.
- PR flow stabilized: push to feature branch (`ci/required-checks`), run checks, then merge only after policy gates.

## Process / Policy Updates
- Created `docs/PR_FLOW.md` with explicit PR-first workflow.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to include default operating mode:
  - PR-first
  - green-checks-only
  - no merge before required checks are green (+ approvals/comments resolved).

## Collaboration Preference (Markus)
- Explicitly confirmed: **no merge before tests/checks pass**.
- Requested agent to create and start an intensive training flow for Nuxt agent team.

## Training Program Artifacts (Nuxt Agent Team)
- Established/expanded senior training package under `docs/training/nuxt-agent-team/`:
  - `README.md`
  - `curriculum.md`
  - `runbook.md`
  - `assignments.md`
  - `evaluation-scorecard.md`
  - `completion-report.md`
- Added operational execution files:
  - `operations/day-01-kickoff.md`
  - `operations/training-tracker.md`
- Training status moved to **IN EXECUTION**.

## Environment Constraint Reminder
- In sandbox runtime, `git`/`gh`/`npm` may be unavailable; in those cases Markus executes local GitHub commands while agent drives diagnosis/fixes.
