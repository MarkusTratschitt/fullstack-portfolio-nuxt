- Telegram pairing flow clarified: `openclaw pairing approve` requires both channel and pairing code (`openclaw pairing approve telegram <CODE>`).
- Confirmed Telegram user/chat ID for owner: `7537680666`.
- ClawHub auth completed successfully (`clawhub whoami` -> `MarkusTratschitt`).
- Installed skills in workspace: `sonoscli`, `answeroverflow`, `agents`, plus uploaded `skill-guard-1.0.2`.
- `skill-guard` script works but requires `uv/uvx` (installed via Astral installer).
- `sonoscli` skill installed, but host runtime binary `sonos` is not installed yet.
- `answeroverflow` live search test blocked by missing Brave API key; direct fetch hit Vercel security checkpoint (429).
