# Curriculum (Senior Intensive)

## Phase 1 — Foundation & Standards (Day 1)

### Objectives
- Align on Nuxt 3 runtime model (SSR/CSR/Hybrid, Nitro, route rules).
- Establish Vuetify 3 integration and design-system consistency rules.
- Lock strict TS + modular architecture standards.

### Content
- Nuxt 3 architecture boundaries (pages/components/composables/stores/server).
- Vuetify plugin strategy, theming, accessibility baseline.
- Best-practice conventions: naming, folder boundaries, feature ownership.
- Modular code patterns: feature slice, service isolation, composable contracts.

### Output
- Team architecture matrix and coding rules confirmed.

---

## Phase 2 — Implementation Sprints (Day 2)

### Objectives
- Apply patterns on realistic feature work.
- Validate modular decomposition and reusable UI patterns.

### Content
- Implement one feature end-to-end with:
  - typed API contract,
  - feature-local composables/services,
  - Vuetify UI with accessibility checks,
  - i18n-safe text handling.
- Refactor one legacy component into modular structure.

### Output
- Working PR with all required checks and senior-level structure.

## Phase 3 — Hardening, Quality & Delivery (Day 3)

### Objectives
- Institutionalize quality gates and review discipline.
- Ensure resilient CI pipeline and production readiness.

### Content
- CI gates: lint → typecheck → unit-tests → e2e-smoke → build.
- Senior review patterns: risk notes, rollback plan, observability checks.
- Performance & DX: route-level strategy, bundle awareness, regression guardrails.

### Output
- Final review board pass + completion scorecard.

---

## KPIs / Completion Criteria
- 100% required checks green on final PR.
- 0 unresolved review conversations.
- At least 1 qualified approval.
- Scorecard >= 85/100 with no critical category below threshold.
